## How to Work with run.dat Files:
- Text-based run.dat Files: You can usually open these files in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code) if they are in plain text format.
- Binary run.dat Files: If the file is binary, you may need specific software or scripts to interpret or extract the data.
-- If you're working with a specific framework or tool that uses a run.dat file, the tool's documentation would be the best place to look for detailed information about the format and usage.
